<aside class="notes">
- stateless functional components: big question in react = state management. Very sensitive to side effects. Facebook encourages writing small components called stateless functional, which are pure functions<br>
- immutable state, we display when the state changes. Problem to know if the state changes, with immutable we know
- undo: difficulty of adding an undo in a web app? React + immutable = easy, even time travel
- bacon.js: functional reactive programming, works on event streams<br>
